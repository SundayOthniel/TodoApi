# Audience

This documentation is intended for developers or individuals aiming to utilize this API for development or personal purposes.

## Getting Started on Your Local Machine

### Requirements

**Note:** All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, which is located at the root directory (`/TODO/requirements.txt`). To ensure clarity, the following prerequisites must be met to successfully run the application on your local machine:

1. **Python**

   - It is recommended to install the slightly older stable version of Python (version 3.12.7) using [this link](#) to avoid potential errors during the installation of `mysqlclient`. The current version of `mysqlclient` may lack pre-compiled `.whl` support for the latest Python releases.
   - Ensure to follow the proper Python installation steps.

2. **Pillow**

   - The latest version of `Pillow` is fully supported and compatible.

3. **Django**

   - The current version of Django works efficiently with the project setup.

4. **Django Rest Framework**

   - As the `API` is built using Django Rest Framework, installing the latest version of Django Rest Framework works fine.

5. **argon2-cffi**
   - The `argon2-cffi` library implements the Argon2 password hashing algorithm, which is essential for secure password hashing. Installing the latest version does not negatively affect this `API`.
